# CryptoSense

4th Flutter Learning Project. App to fetch crypto-currency's information.

## Description

- CryptoSense will use REST API to process data.
- Dio: A powerful HTTP networking package.
  - supports Interceptors, 
  - Aborting and canceling a request, 
  - Custom adapters, 
  - Transformers, etc.
- Get_it: Simple direct Service Locator that allows to decouple the interface from a concrete implementation and to access the concrete implementation from everywhere in your App
  - Typical usage:
    - Accessing service objects like REST API clients or databases so that they easily can be mocked. 
    - Accessing View/AppModels/Managers/BLoCs from Flutter Views
- Used CoinGecko API: It provides a 360Â° view of cryptocurrencies. 
  - It is a free API for current and historical cryptocurrency data. 
  - It provides support for more than 5000 cryptocurrencies and 100,000+ currency pairs. 
  - It provides a single interface into all major crypto exchanges, including binance, bitfinex, bitstamp, coinbase, etc.]
